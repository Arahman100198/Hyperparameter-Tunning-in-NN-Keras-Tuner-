# Hyperparameter Tuning in Neural Networks with Keras Tuner

This repository demonstrates how to perform hyperparameter tuning in Neural Networks using **Keras Tuner**. The tuning process includes selecting the appropriate **optimizer**, determining the **number of neurons (nodes)** in a layer, selecting the **number of layers** in the network, and choosing the **activation functions**. These hyperparameters are optimized to improve the modelâ€™s performance.

## Overview

In this project, we explore the following key aspects of hyperparameter tuning in neural networks:

1. **Optimizer Selection**  
2. **Number of Neurons per Layer**  
3. **Number of Layers in the Network**  
4. **Activation Functions**
5. **All in One**

We utilize **Keras Tuner** to perform a **Random Search** optimization on each of these parameters, and determine the best configuration based on model performance.
